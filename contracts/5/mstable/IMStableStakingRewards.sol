/**
 * @title  StakingRewards
 * @author Originally: Synthetix (forked from /Synthetixio/synthetix/contracts/StakingRewards.sol)
 *         Audit: https://github.com/sigp/public-audits/blob/master/synthetix/unipool/review.pdf
 *         Changes by: Stability Labs Pty. Ltd.
 * @notice Rewards stakers of a given LP token (a.k.a StakingToken) with RewardsToken, on a pro-rata basis
 * @dev    Uses an ever increasing 'rewardPerTokenStored' variable to distribute rewards
 * each time a write action is called in the contract. This allows for passive reward accrual.
 *         Changes:
 *           - Cosmetic (comments, readability)
 *           - Addition of getRewardToken()
 *           - Changing of `StakingTokenWrapper` funcs from `super.stake` to `_stake`
 *           - Introduced a `stake(_beneficiary)` function to enable contract wrappers to stake on behalf
